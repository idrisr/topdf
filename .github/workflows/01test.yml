# Use the upload-artifact action:
  # In your workflow, add the upload-artifact action to upload the generated
  # artifacts to GitHub Actions. This action allows you to specify the artifact
  # name, path, and other metadata.
# Create a release:
  # In your workflow, use the create-release action to create a new release in
  # your GitHub repository. This action requires a release_name, tag_name, and
  # other metadata.
# Upload artifacts to the release:
  # Use the upload-release-asset action to upload the previously uploaded
  # artifacts to the newly created release. This action requires the upload_url,
  # asset_path, asset_name, and asset_content_type parameters.
